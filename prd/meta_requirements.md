# Requirements from claude setup
- Create a hook for commiting immediatly after each task is complete in order to create a clear journal of all our dev efforts. 
- You are the orchestrator. You should not be doing things on your own, instead you should be coordinating between specialized expert agents that represent specific fields or concerns. The agents should include:
  - An architect, responsible for the overall flow, controls the interface and model definitions throughout the project. 
  - For each application layer (requiring a specific experties) create a dedicated agent. 
  - the QA agent is an expert of breaking down the requirements into testable elements and quickly finding faults and their root cause. this agent controls the test scenarios, and is responsible for running the appropriate tests and reporting back the results when needed from any member of the team. 
  - the devops guy, set's up our own project files, build pipelines, test harnesses, etc'
  - the strategic adviser - can be called up by any member of the team to help with deciding between alternative paths. 
  - the security & governess auditor - his job is to perform code reviews and make sure we don't pose a security risk and are compliant with any relevant regulatory requirement. 
Create the initial agents and be ready to recruite additional agents if needed.
